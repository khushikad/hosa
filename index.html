    <h1>Skin Cancer Detector</h1>

    <h3>
        Our project focuses on detecting potential skin cancer in patients using a simple and accessible approach. Skin cancer is often visible to the naked eye, making early detection possible. The process starts with taking a picture of the affected area. After uploading the image, you press the "Analyze" button, which processes the photo to identify any abnormalities. Next, you answer a series of questions about symptoms you may be experiencing. Based on this information, the system determines whether you might have skin cancer, identifies the possible stage, and provides suggestions for treatment and next steps
